# Learn To Code

* Each week, any Kata covered in the Wednesday Learn to code sessions (from Codewars or otherwise) can be added to this repo. 
* We can then create our own branches to complete the weeks Kata.
* Try to follow test driven development practices.
* Pushing your branch up to the repo will hopefully aid in the discussion of solutions and we can learn from each other. Feel free to add comments or can discuss/review at the start of the following session.
